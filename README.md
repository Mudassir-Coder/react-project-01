🎨 Nike Landing Page Clone (React & Tailwind CSS)

🌟 Project Overview

This repository showcases a pixel-perfect, highly responsive clone of the official Nike website's main landing page.Built entirely with modern React component architecture and styled using the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, this project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my front-end development capabilities, particularly in replicating complex commercial UI/UX designs.

Utility-First Styling: Leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid, maintainable, and highly customized styling without writing custom CSS classes.
